# mini-stl
Personal implementations of parts of the C++ Standard Template Library. All mistakes are my own.

### Implementations
| What      | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| string      |        |
| unique_ptr   |         |
| shared_ptr   |         |
| vector   |         |
| map   |         |
| set   |         |
| unordered_map   |         |
| unordered_set   |         |

Roadmap:
1. Add basic vector outline
2. Write simple test harness, with memory safety, behavior, and performance checks.
3. Beef up vector outline and implement `ministl::allocator`
